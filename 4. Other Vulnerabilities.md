#### 1. JWT related attacks

##### What is?

* JWT attacks involve a user sending modified JWTs to the server in order to achieve a malicious goal.

##### How do vulnerabilities to JWT attacks arise?

* JWT vulnerabilities typically arise due to flawed JWT handling within the application itself.

#### 2. Session Hijacking


* The Session Hijacking attack consists of the exploitation of the web session control mechanism, which is normally managed for a session token.
* Because http communication uses many different TCP connections, the web server needs a method to recognize every user’s connections. The most useful method depends on a token that the Web Server sends to the client browser after a successful client authentication. (Session ID)
* Doing MITM attack to steal session ID.

#### 3. Session Fixation

* Session Fixation is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session. The attack explores a limitation in the way the web application manages the session ID, more specifically the vulnerable web application.

* (1)The attacker has to establish a legitimate connection with the web server which (2) issues a session ID or, the attacker can create a new session with the proposed session ID, then, (3) the attacker has to send a link with the established session ID to the victim, they have to click on the link sent from the attacker accessing the site, (4) the Web Server saw that session was already established and a new one need not to be created, (5) the victim provides their credentials to the Web Server, (6) knowing the session ID, the attacker can access the user’s account.

#### Diff. reverse shell vs bind shell

* Reverse shell attacks are often initiated by the victim's system receiving a command from the attacker's system.
* Bind shell attacks are initiated by the attacker's system listening for incoming connections on a specific port.
