#### 1. Cross-site Scripting

##### What is?

* Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application.

##### Types of XSS

1. Reflected XSS -  where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
2. Stored XSS - where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
3. DOM-based XSS - where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

##### Impact of RXSS
* If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things.

##### Impact of SXSS
* If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user.

##### DOM XSS

* DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities usually arise when JavaScript takes data from an attacker-controllable source, such as the URL, and passes it to a sink that supports dynamic code execution, such as `eval()` or `innerHTML`.
* DOM based cross site scripting occurs when JavaScript code accepts a user’s input (**source**) and passes that input to another function that displays the results back to the page (**sink**) in an unsafe manner.


##### How to fix?

- **Filter input on arrival.** At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input.
- **Encode data on output.** At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.
- **Use appropriate response headers.** To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the `Content-Type` and `X-Content-Type-Options` headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend.
- **Content Security Policy.** As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.

#### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery

##### What is?
* Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform.

#### How to make POC?
* Just make it

##### How to fix?

* *CSRF tokens** - A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client.

#### 3. Client Side Template Injection

What is?
* Client-side template injection vulnerabilities arise when applications using a client-side template framework dynamically embed user input in web pages.

#### 4. Cross Origin Resource Sharing

##### What is?
* Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain.
* Many modern websites use CORS to allow access from subdomains and trusted third parties. Their implementation of CORS may contain mistakes or be overly lenient to ensure that everything works, and this can result in exploitable vulnerabilities.

##### How to prevent CORS based attacks

* Proper configuration of cross-origin requests
* Only allow trusted sites
* Avoid whitelisting null
* Avoid wildcards in internal networks
* CORS is not a substitute for server-side security policies
